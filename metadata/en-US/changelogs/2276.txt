Notices

People keep asking me to add new, often exotic, features to the app, to whom I often say "no", and other people complain about too many features.
Both groups of people leave bad reviews for this, which is frustrating, also because there are already enough bad reviews for the wrong reasons
(email server problems, which unfortunately happen too often, etc.).
The main problem is that more features now make more people unhappy than happy.
Therefore, the rules for new features will be strictly followed from today.

No worries, the app will continue to be maintained and supported as usual.

---

Google requires FairEmail to undergo an annual CASA security audit,
which must be conducted by an authorized assessor (this year TAC Security.
Besides being time-consuming, this is no longer free as of this year.
This is one of the reasons why the app cannot be completely free, meaning some features must be paid for in order to pay for an annual security audit.
To be clear, nothing will be changed for now.

The security audit revealed no problems, so Google accounts can continue to be used as usual for a year.
