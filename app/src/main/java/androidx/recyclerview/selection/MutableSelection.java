/**
 * Subclass of {@link Selection} exposing public support for mutating the underlying
 * selection data. This is useful for clients of {@link SelectionTracker} that wish to
 * manipulate a copy of selection data obtained via
 * {@link SelectionTracker#copySelection(MutableSelection)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * While the {@link Selection} class is not intrinsically immutable, it is not mutable
 * by non-library code. Furthermore the value returned from {@link SelectionTracker#getSelection()}
 * is a live view of the underlying selection, mutable by the library itself.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link MutableSelection} allows clients to obtain a mutable copy of the Selection
 * state held by the selection library. This is useful in situations where a stable
 * snapshot of the selection is required.
 *
 *
 * <p><b>Example</b>
 *
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * MutableSelection snapshot = new MutableSelection();
 * selectionTracker.copySelection(snapshot);
 *
 * // Clear the user visible selection.
 * selectionTracker.clearSelection();
 * // tracker.getSelection().isEmpty() will be true.
 * // shapshot has a copy of the previous selection.
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see android.text.Selection
 *
 * @param <K> Selection key type. @see {@link StorageStrategy} for supported types.
