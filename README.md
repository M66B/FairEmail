# FairEmail

*Open source, privacy friendly email app*

This email app might be for you if your current email app:

* takes long to receive or show messages
* can manage only one email address
* cannot show conversations
* cannot work offline
* looks outdated
* is not maintained
* stores your email on their servers
* is closed source, potentially violating your privacy

This app is minimalistic by design, so you can concentrate on reading and writing messages.

This app starts a foreground service with a low priority status bar notification to make sure you'll never miss new email.
