## Downloads

Supported download locations:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/M66B/FairEmail/releases)
* [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.email)
* [Play store](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/eu.faircode.email) (test)
* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.faircode.email/) ([last build status](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/eu.faircode.email/lastbuild)) (the F-Droid app can be downloaded [here](https://f-droid.org/))
* ~~[AppGallery](https://wap3.hispace.hicloud.com/uowap/index.jsp#/detailApp/C101678151) (the AppGallery app can be downloaded [here](https://huaweimobileservices.com/appgallery/))~~

**Important**: after enrolling in the [Advanced Protection Program](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/)
you cannot use third party email apps anymore, please see [this FAQ](https://github.com/M66B/FairEmail/blob/master/FAQ.md#user-content-faq22) for more information.

The Gmail quick setup wizard can be used in official releases only (Play store or GitHub) because Google approved the use of OAuth for one app signature only.

**Important**: Gsuite accounts authorized with a username/password will stop working
[in the near future](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/12/less-secure-apps-oauth-google-username-password-incorrect.html).
Gsuite accounts authorized with the quick setup wizard (OAuth) will keep working.

To download a GitHub release you might need to expand the assets section to download the [APK file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package).

The GitHub version is being updated more often than the Play store version.
The GitHub release will automatically check for updates on GitHub (this can be turned off in the miscellaneous settings).

F-Droid builds new versions irregularly and you'll need the F-Droid client to get update notifications.
To get updates in a timely fashion you are advised to use the GitHub release.

Because F-Droid builds and GitHub releases are signed differently, an F-Droid build needs to be uninstalled first to be able to update to a GitHub release.

Certificate fingerprints:

```
MD5: 64:90:8E:2C:0D:25:29:B0:D0:26:2D:24:D8:BB:66:56
SHA1: 17:BA:15:C1:AF:55:D9:25:F9:8B:99:CE:A4:37:5D:4C:DF:4C:17:4B
SHA256: E0:20:67:24:9F:5A:35:0E:0E:C7:03:FE:9D:F4:DD:68:2E:02:91:A0:9F:0C:2E:04:10:50:BB:E7:C0:64:F5:C9
```

One line command to display certificate fingerprints:

```unzip -p fairemail.apk META-INF/CERT.RSA | keytool -printcert```

I do not hand over the signing keys of my apps to Google.
However, in the second half of 2021 [I am required](https://commonsware.com/blog/2020/09/23/uncomfortable-questions-app-signing.html) to hand over my signing keys to Google.

## Compatibility

FairEmail requires at least Android 5 Lollipop.

Individual message notifications are available on Android 7 Nougat and later only
because earlier Android versions do not support notification grouping.

Notification settings (sounds) per account/folder/sender are available on Android 8 Oreo and later only
because earlier Android versions do not support notification channels.

FairEmail will work properly on devices without any Google service installed.
