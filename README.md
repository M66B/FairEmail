## Downloads

Supported download locations:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/M66B/FairEmail/releases)
* [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.email)
* [Play store](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/eu.faircode.email) (test)
* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.faircode.email/) (the F-Droid app can be downloaded [here](https://f-droid.org/))
* [IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/eu.faircode.email) (verified GitHub release)
* ~~[AppGallery](https://wap3.hispace.hicloud.com/uowap/index.jsp#/detailApp/C101678151) (the AppGallery app can be downloaded [here](https://huaweimobileservices.com/appgallery/))~~
* ~~[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0983R6MH2)~~ (the APK file repackaged by Amazon is incomplete! An issue report was never answered by Amazon.)

Please see [this FAQ](https://m66b.github.io/FairEmail/#faq173) about the differences between the different releases.

**Important**: after enrolling in the [Advanced Protection Program](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/)
you cannot use third party email apps anymore, please see [this FAQ](https://m66b.github.io/FairEmail/#faq22) for more information.

To download a GitHub release you might need to expand the assets section to download the [APK file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package).

The GitHub version is being updated more often than the Play store version.
The GitHub release will automatically check for updates on GitHub (this can be turned off in the miscellaneous settings).

F-Droid builds new versions irregularly and you'll need the F-Droid client to get update notifications.
To get updates in a timely fashion you are advised to use the GitHub release.

**Important**: There is support on the F-Droid build only if the version number of the F-Droid build is the same as the version number of the latest GitHub release.
Please [see here](https://m66b.github.io/FairEmail/#faq147) for more information on third-party builds.

Because F-Droid builds and GitHub releases are signed differently, an F-Droid build needs to be uninstalled first to be able to update to a GitHub release.

The best way to verify the integrity of an APK file is documented [here](https://m66b.github.io/FairEmail/#faq205).

Certificate fingerprints:

```
MD5: 64:90:8E:2C:0D:25:29:B0:D0:26:2D:24:D8:BB:66:56
SHA1: 17:BA:15:C1:AF:55:D9:25:F9:8B:99:CE:A4:37:5D:4C:DF:4C:17:4B
SHA256: E0:20:67:24:9F:5A:35:0E:0E:C7:03:FE:9D:F4:DD:68:2E:02:91:A0:9F:0C:2E:04:10:50:BB:E7:C0:64:F5:C9
```

One line command to display certificate fingerprints:

```unzip -p fairemail.apk META-INF/CERT.RSA | keytool -printcert```

I do not hand over the signing keys of my apps to Google.
Please see [this Google blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/the-future-of-android-app-bundles-is.html)
and [this article](https://commonsware.com/blog/2020/09/23/uncomfortable-questions-app-signing.html)
for more information.

## Compatibility

FairEmail requires at least Android 5 Lollipop.

FairEmail is supported on smartphones and tablets only, and for example not on E Ink devices.

Individual message notifications are available on Android 7 Nougat and later only
because earlier Android versions do not support notification grouping.

Notification settings (sounds) per account/folder/sender are available on Android 8 Oreo and later only
because earlier Android versions do not support notification channels.

FairEmail will work properly on devices without any Google service installed.

Please see [here](https://m66b.github.io/FairEmail/#known-problems) for known problems.
