This tag gives user-specific information.  Autodiscover must be UTF-8 encoded.

		<!-- Account: Required
This tag specifies the type of account, such as Email vs Newsgroups, vs SIP server, etc.
-->
		<Account>
			<!-- AccountType: Required
This value indicates the type of the account.
VALUES:
email: The values under this Account tag indicate configuration settings for an email server.
nntp: The values under this Account tag indicate configuration settings for a NNTP server. (not used by Outlook 2007)

			<!-- Action: Required
This value indicates if the goal of this account results is to provide the settings or redirect to another web server that can provide results.
VALUES:
redirectUrl: If this value is specified, then the URL tag will specify the http: or https: URL containing the Autodiscover results to be used.  In order to prevent the server from being able to send the client into an infinite loop, the client should stop redirecting after 10 redirects.
redirectAddr: If this value is specified, then the XML tag will specify the e-mail address that Outlook should use to execute Autodiscover again.  In other words, the server is telling the client that the e-mail address the client should really be using for Autodiscover is not the one that was posted, but the one specified in this tag. 
settings: If this value is specified, then the XML will contain the settings needed to configure the account.  The settings will primarily be under the PROTOCOL tag.

The value will be a https: URL that the client should use to obtain the Autodiscover settings or a http: URL that the client should use for further redirection.

				<!-- TTL: Optional.
The value here specifies the time to live in hours that these settings are valid for.

If no value is specified, the default will be a TTL of 1 hour.
-->
				<TTL>%TTL%</TTL>
				<!-- Server: Required.
The value here specifies the name of the mail server corresponding to the server type specified above.
For protocols such as POP3, SMTP, IMAP, or NNTP, this value will be either a hostname or an IP address.
For protocols such as DAV or WEB, this will be an URL.
-->
				<Server>%SERVER/IMAP/HOST%</Server>
				<!--IP Addr or DNS name of server-->
				<!-- Port: Optional.
The value specifies the Port number to use.  If no value is specified, the default settings will be used depending on the mail server type.  This value is not used if the SERVER tag contains an URL.

				<!-- LoginName: Optional.
This value specifies the user's login.  If no value is specified, the default will be set to the string preceding the '@' in the email address.  If the Login name contains a domain, the format should be <Username>@<Domain>.  Such as JoeUser@SalesDomain.
-->
				<!--
<LoginName>johndoe</LoginName>

				<!-- DomainRequired: Optional.  Default is off.
If this value is true, then a domain is required during authentication.  If the domain is not specified in the LOGINNAME tag, or the LOGINNAME tag was not specified, the user will need to enter the domain before authentication will succeed.
